//Use return 0...
//in main() if you want to follow standard practice and ensure compatibility with older compilers. Otherwise, in modern C++, itâ€™s optional.
//Using **return 0;** at the end of the main() function indicates that the program has successfully completed. In C++:
//return 0;: Means the program ended without errors.
//return 1; or other values: May indicate an error or a specific exit code.
//When NOT to Omit It:
//If you use an older C++ standard (before C++11).
//If you want to return specific error codes for debugging or system integration.
